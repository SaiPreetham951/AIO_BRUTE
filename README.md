# AIO_BRUTE

# Clean UI implementation


# This Code is a brute forcer for some websites 
  Which can run any number of threads based on your 
  CPU capacity.

# This uses Threading and http request to send requests.

# This supports all kind of captcha solving services, Which can be
  used to solve captchas for few sites which protects themself from
  brute force by adding captchas to login pages

# Discord Bot embedded into the code to send current brute
  Working status and other info directly to your discord server
  or account (Users can choose to use discord or not).

# Most of the APIs have been removed, cuz I don't want to leak or
  Cause any problem to anyone
